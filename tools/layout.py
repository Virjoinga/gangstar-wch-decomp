"""The layout of the retail library: which source file every function came from.

The retail shared object was shipped with its symbol table intact, which gives
the project two independent signals about the original source tree.

**The file manifest.**  ``STT_FILE`` symbols are emitted once per object file.
The retail library lists 689 of them, so the complete list of source files
Gameloft compiled into the game is known exactly.

**Per-function attribution.**  Two signals are combined:

* *Scope.*  Most of the game's classes live in a file named after them
  (``Vehicle`` -> ``Vehicle.cpp``).  Where the scope names a file that exists
  in the manifest, the attribution is exact.
* *Anchors.*  A ``STT_FILE`` symbol is followed by the local symbols of its
  object file, and the linker lays the objects out contiguously in ``.text``.
  The address of a local symbol therefore marks a position inside a known
  object, and the closest anchor below a function identifies its object.

The two signals agree on 97% of the functions where both apply, which is what
makes the combination trustworthy.
